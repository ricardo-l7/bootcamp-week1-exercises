                Welcome to my "About Me" page! My name is Ricardo Linares, I am a first-year at 
                Harvard University, and I live in Holworthy Middle. I come from a relatively small 
                western suburb of Chicago (~9000) called Riverside. I graduated from Riverside Brookfield
                High School in 2020 and decided to take a gap year because of COVID. During the "first
                semester" of my gap year I lived in Waikiki on Oahu with three other Harvard gap year students.
                There I was a research assitant at UHM and surfed basically everyday. After Hawai'i I went on 
                a two week trip to Tanzania, Africa with my friend Will. We saw all of the "Big 5" and even
                got to see all 7 of the East African Wild Cats. After Africa, I worked in a neurodegenerative
                disease lab for six months at UIC. I would go to work ~9:00AM and get back around 4PM. After work
                I would lift in my garage with my brothers and spend the rest of the day either golfing, watching youtube,
                fishing, or reading. I come from a pretty big family (see the list to the left). From my Dad's side 
                alone I have ~60 cousins, and from my mom's side I have 9. Thanks for reading about me!
